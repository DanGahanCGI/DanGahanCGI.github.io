Dear Mr O’Sullivan
Special Conditions

You will be aware that Ofqual has been in discussion with representatives of the
University in relation to the governance arrangements of Cambridge Assessment
International Education and Cambridge Assessment English and Ofqual’s regulatory
requirements.

David Parson's email of 26 January 2018 to Ofqual confirmed approval of the
proposed Special Conditions sent to it by Ofqual on 14 December 2017 (with minor
technical amendments to reflect the formal title of the University).

We are therefore sending alongside this letter, Special Conditions CU1 and CU2,
which have now been imposed and which have immediate effect.

You will see that the definition of ‘Governing Body’ in Condition J1.8 of Ofqual’s
General Conditions of Recognition, in respect of the University which is the entity we
regulate and which is accountable to Ofqual for Cambridge Assessment International
Education and Cambridge Assessment English, is replaced with the Press and
Assessment Board.

In the interests of transparency, please note that Ofqual intends to publish these
Special Conditions on our website.

If you have any queries relating to this letter please let us know as soon as possible.
Yours sincerely,

Sonia Sharma
Senior Lawyer
