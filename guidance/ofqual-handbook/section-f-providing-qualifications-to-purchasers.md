#  Section F - Providing qualifications to purchasers

Rules about providing information on qualification fees and features,
packaging qualifications with other products or services, and invoicing.

## Condition F1 - Information on fees

### Making fee information available

1. F1.1 In respect of each of its qualifications that it makes available for purchase, an awarding organisation must publish the following information for potential purchasers in England – 
  1. (a) where possible, the Standard Qualification Fee.
  2. (b) where applicable, any Package Fee.
  3. (c) where possible, any Associated Learner Fees.
  4. (d) where possible, any Mandatory Centre Fees.
  5. (e) where it is not possible for the awarding organisation to calculate a Standard Qualification Fee, Associated Learner Fees or any Mandatory Centre Fees, a statement of the method by which these fees are calculated.

1. F1.2 An awarding organisation must ensure that the information which it publishes as required by Condition F1.1 is – 
  1. (a) kept up to date,
  2. (b) clear to a potential purchaser, and
  3. (c) easily accessible to any potential purchaser without that person having to request it from, or provide any information to, the awarding organisation.

### Making fee information available to satisfy the planning requirements of
purchasers

1. F1.3 An awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to publish the information required by Condition F1.1 sufficiently far in advance of the time at which the qualifications to which that information relates will be made available to Learners as to satisfy the reasonable planning requirements of potential purchasers.

1. F1.4 Where such information cannot be published to this timescale, the awarding organisation must instead provide or make available to potential purchasers information that is sufficient to give a reasonable indication of its likely fees, together with a clear statement to make potential purchasers aware that this information is only indicative.

1. F1.5 In respect of each of its qualifications that it makes available for purchase, an awarding organisation must make the information set out in Condition F1.1(a) – (e) available for potential purchasers outside England on request.

### Guidance on Condition F1

#### Introduction

Condition F1.1 requires an awarding organisation to publish fees for its
qualifications on its website (in accordance with Condition J1.7(c)).  


Condition F1.2 builds on this obligation, requiring awarding organisations to
make fee information easily accessible to any potential purchaser, without
them having to request it from, or provide any information to, the awarding
organisation.  


When deciding how this information should be presented, and how particular
services should be identified and categorised, an awarding organisation must
have regard to this guidance.  


##### Use of defined terms

Awarding organisations are not obliged to use the defined terms ‘Standard
Qualification Fee’, ‘Package Fee’, ‘Associated Learner Fees’ or ‘Mandatory
Centre Fees’ that we have published in Condition J1.8 when publishing fee
information.  


Where these defined terms are not used, however, the awarding organisation
should make clear which fee constitutes the Standard Qualification Fee and, if
applicable, the Package Fee for each qualification. In addition, the awarding
organisation should make clear which fees constitute the Associated Learner
Fees and Mandatory Centre Fees categories.  


Each fee, however it is labelled, should represent all of the information that
must be covered by the Standard Qualification Fee, Package Fee, Associated
Learner Fees or Mandatory Centre Fees respectively, as set out in the
Conditions of Recognition and the guidance below.  


##### Publication “where possible”

Condition F1.1 requires awarding organisations to publish the Standard
Qualification Fee, any Associated Learner Fees and any Mandatory Centre Fees
“where possible”. This means that the requirement will apply in almost all
circumstances.  


Where, in accordance with Condition F1.1(e), it is not possible for an
awarding organisation to calculate a Standard Qualification Fee, Associated
Learner Fees or any Mandatory Centre Fees, the awarding organisation must
publish a statement of the method by which these fees are calculated. We
consider that this will only apply in exceptional circumstances, where the
awarding organisation can demonstrate that complying with the requirements of
one or more of Conditions F1.1(a) to F1.1(d) is not possible. Any statement of
method must be clear and readily capable of being understood by potential
purchasers.  


##### The “purchaser”

Condition F1 refers to purchasers and potential purchasers of qualifications.
This term is not defined in Condition J1.8, and therefore has its ordinary
meaning: anyone who pays (or, in the case of potential purchasers, might pay)
the awarding organisation’s fees for the qualification.  


In many cases, the purchaser will be a Centre. This will be the case whenever
a Centre pays any of the awarding organisation’s fees for the qualification,
irrespective of whether or not the Centre subsequently recharges those fees to
individual Learners. It also includes situations where a Centre pays a fee to
the awarding organisation on behalf of one or more Learners.  


Individual Learners can also be purchasers (or potential purchasers) for the
purposes of Condition F1. This will be the case whenever individual Learners
pay (or might pay) any fees directly to the awarding organisation.  


##### Application to markets outside England

While Ofqual-regulated qualifications are regulated by Ofqual wherever in the
world they are taken, Ofqual’s requirement to publish fees in Condition F1.1
applies only in respect of potential purchasers in England.  


For potential purchasers outside England, our Condition F1.5 applies. This
requires awarding organisations to make fee information available on request.  


Awarding organisations should be aware that CCEA Regulation and Qualifications
Wales have equivalent rules, and that these require publication of fee
information for potential purchasers in Northern Ireland and Wales
(respectively).

#### Standard Qualification Fee

The Standard Qualification Fee is intended to offer clarity to purchasers or
potential purchasers about mandatory fees.  


The Standard Qualification Fee must include all mandatory fees that must be
paid in respect of a single Learner progressing from registration for the
qualification through to certification. As such, it should include, but is not
be limited to, any fees for:

* qualification/unit entry
* assessment carried out by the awarding organisation
* marking carried out by the awarding organisation and/or Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny, including Moderation (if these are payable in respect of for individual Learners)
* mandatory assessment materials (if these must be purchased from the awarding organisation)
* notification of results
* issuing of certificates

In calculating a Standard Qualification Fee, an awarding organisation should
assume the Learner completes all assessments at the first attempt.  


The Standard Qualification Fee should reflect current prices. An awarding
organisation may have different fees for different optional routes through a
qualification. Where that is the case, the Standard Qualification Fee should
reflect the most likely combination of options Learners will take in order to
be awarded the qualification.

Example 1  
---  
There are three optional routes (Options A, B and C) through a qualification,
each priced differently. Option A is typically taken by 15% of Learners,
Option B by 25% and Option C by 60%.  

The Standard Qualification Fee should therefore reflect the price of Option C.  
Example 2  
---  
An awarding organisation is introducing a new qualification with two
differently-priced optional routes through it (Options A and B). It expects,
based on entry patterns for similar qualifications it has offered in the past,
that more Learners will take Option B.  

When the qualification is made available for the first time, the Standard
Qualification Fee should therefore reflect the fees for Option B.  

Once it starts awarding the qualification, the awarding organisation observes
that around 70% of Learners are in fact taking Option A. The awarding
organisation then revises its published Standard Qualification Fee to reflect
the fees for Option A.  

An awarding organisation is not required to publish a breakdown explaining how
it has calculated the Standard Qualification Fee, but equally is not precluded
from doing so.  


An awarding organisation can also choose to publish information which
specifies or illustrates costs of alternative options (or combinations of
options) that may be relevant for potential purchasers.  


It is of course open for awarding organisations to negotiate discounts on any
of its fees (including those that fall within the Standard Qualification Fee)
with potential purchasers, for example based on their expected cohort size, or
to reflect their role in developing or delivering the qualification.  


##### Fees excluded from the Standard Qualification Fee

Some fees should not be included in the Standard Qualification Fee. In most
cases, awarding organisations must still publish these fees in order to comply
with Conditions F1.1(b) to F1.1(d).  


Examples of fees that should be excluded from the Standard Qualification Fee
might include:

* periodic or one-off Learner registration fees (to be included in Associated Learner Fees)
* periodic or one-off professional membership fees (if obligatory and payable to the awarding organisation, to be included in Associated Learner Fees)
* fees for Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny (including Moderation) payable in respect of a group of Learners (to be included in Mandatory Centre Fees)
* fees for learning materials not required for assessment (if obligatory and purchased from the awarding organisation, then this would be a Package Fee)
* fees for any goods or services required to be purchased alongside the qualification, as a package (to be included in a Package Fee)
* any fee charged by a Centre to a Learner which is not payable to, or otherwise required by, the awarding organisation. Examples of such fees might include Centre charges for delivering or carrying out assessments, or for raw materials used in assessments.

Example 3  
---  
An awarding organisation charges a one-off registration fee the first time a
Learner attempts one of the awarding organisation’s qualifications. This fee
is not charged if the Learner takes the same qualification again, or has
previously paid the fee when taking another of the awarding organisation’s
qualifications.  

Since this fee is not payable every time a Learner takes the qualification, it
should not be included in the Standard Qualification Fee.  

However, it would be an Associated Learner Fee, and the awarding organisation
would still need to publish it to comply with Condition F1.1(c).  
Example 4  
---  
An awarding organisation also acts as a membership body. It requires Learners
to join that membership body in order to take one of its qualifications. It
charges a membership fee every time a Learner attempts that qualification,
irrespective of whether or not the Learner has previously paid a membership
fee.  

This fee must be included in the Standard Qualification Fee.  
Example 5  
---  
An awarding organisation also acts as a professional body. It requires
Learners taking its qualifications to be members of that professional body,
which charges an annual membership fee.  

Because Learners do not need to pay the membership fee every time they attempt
one of the awarding organisation’s qualifications, it should not be included
in the Standard Qualification Fee.  

However, it would be an Associated Learner Fee, and the awarding organisation
would still need to publish it in order to comply with Condition F1.1(c).  

In accordance with Condition E3.2(e), the qualification’s specification must
also make clear that a Learner must be a member of the professional body in
order to be assessed.  

#### Package Fee

Where an awarding organisation only makes a qualification available in a
package with other products or services, the Package Fee represents the
notional fees for those other products or services that are required to be
purchased along with the qualification. The fee should not include the
Standard Qualification Fee for the qualification itself.  


If the awarding organisation makes the qualification available for purchase
separately to the package, then the awarding organisation does not have to
publish a Package Fee. It can, instead, publish details of the package
alongside the Standard Qualification Fee, making clear this is an additional
option.

#### Associated Learner Fees

Associated Learner Fees encompass all fees for optional services directly
related to the delivery and award of a qualification to an individual Learner.
These include, where applicable, the following, and any other relevant fees:

* late entry
* reviews of marking (even if these are not charged, or are refunded, in certain circumstances)
* appeals (even if these may be refunded in certain circumstances)
* taking the qualification again (if this differs from the Standard Qualification Fee)
* replacement certificates
* periodic or one-off Learner registration
* annual professional membership, where membership is a pre-requisite for taking the qualification (even if the awarding organisation and the membership body are separate entities)

These fees may or may not vary by qualification. Where they do not vary they
need not be repeated.  


If the awarding organisation sets fee levels for some elements, such as late
entry fees, as a proportion of the Standard Qualification Fee, then it would
be reasonable to present this fee in that way, rather than publishing the
actual values relevant to each qualification. The awarding organisation’s
overall intention should be for clarity and transparency, in line with
Condition F1.2(b).

#### Mandatory Centre Fees

These fees should represent all mandatory fees that must be paid by a Centre
in order to deliver qualifications, but which would not be included in the
Standard Qualification Fee. These fees would typically be payable in respect
of a group of Learners, or a Centre as a whole.  


These include, where applicable, the following, and any other relevant fees:

* initial Centre approval fees
* annual Centre fees
* Moderation fees payable in respect of a group of Learners, or the Centre as a whole
* fees for periodic, mandatory, visits – for example, for audit or quality assurance
* fees for any other Centre visits where these are required by the awarding organisation
* minimum spending thresholds, alongside the terms relating to their application
* fees related to the delivery of a specific qualification which are payable in respect of a group of Learners
* fees payable in respect of a group of Learners that are not related to a specific qualification

## Condition F2 - Packaging qualifications with other products or services

### Packages offered as an option

1. F2.1 Where an awarding organisation makes available a qualification both in a package with other products or services and separately from those other products or services, it must inform purchasers prior to the time of purchase that the qualification may be purchased separately or in a package.

### Packages offered without alternative options

1. F2.2 An awarding organisation must not make available a qualification in a package together with other products or services unless it also makes available that qualification without other products or services, except where it – 
  1. (a) from time to time seeks comments from purchasers on whether the packaging of the qualification with the particular products or services is appropriate, and
  2. (b) reasonably concludes that continuing to make available the package is appropriate.

### Guidance on Condition F2

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

* puts in place, and follows, a policy which includes details of how it will consider whether or not it is appropriate to introduce or continue to make a qualification available in a package together with other products and services.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

* does not put in place a policy which includes details of how it will consider whether or not it is appropriate to introduce or continue to make a qualification available in a package together with other products and services, or does not follow such a policy which it has put in place;
* considers that it is appropriate to make a qualification available in a package together with other products and services where that package has a negative impact on Learners and/or the purchasers of the qualification.

## Condition F3 - Invoicing

### Invoicing purchasers

1. F3.1 An awarding organisation must – 
  1. (a) ensure that its invoices in relation to the provision of qualifications are issued in a timely manner, and
  2. (b) provide a breakdown of its fees, beyond that already required by HMRC, to a reasonable level of detail following a request from a purchaser.

### The written invoicing policy

1. F3.2 An awarding organisation must establish, maintain, publish and comply with a written policy on invoicing.

1. F3.3 The policy must specify the processes to be followed by the awarding organisation in relation to the issue, payment and retention of invoices and the content of invoices.

There is currently no guidance on complying with these Conditions

*[Standard Qualification Fee]: Standard Qualification Fee: A fee which, subject to negotiation, is payable to an awarding organisation by a purchaser that represents the sum of all mandatory fees that must be paid in respect of an individual Learner for that Learner to have the opportunity to obtain one of the awarding organisation's qualifications, including a certificate in relation to it. This would exclude any Learner pre-requisites clearly set out in the qualification specification, for example prior learning or membership of a professional body. Where an awarding organisation only makes a qualification available as part of a package, together with other products and services, the Standard Qualification Fee will be the notional fee payable in respect of the qualification only.
*[Package Fee]: Package Fee: Where an awarding organisation only makes a qualification available as part of a package together with other products and services, any notional fee which is: subject to negotiation, payable to an awarding organisation by a purchaser of the package in respect of each of those other products and services; and not included in the Standard Qualification Fee.
*[Associated Learner Fees]: Associated Learner Fees: Any fee which is: subject to negotiation, payable to an awarding organisation by a purchaser for an optional service that is directly related to the delivery and award of a regulated qualification to an individual Learner; and not not included in the Standard Qualification Fee.
*[Mandatory Centre Fees]: Mandatory Centre Fees: Any mandatory fee which: subject to negotiation, an awarding organisation requires a Centre to pay to it in order to undertake the delivery of an assessment to Learners (or any other activities) on behalf of the awarding organisation, irrespective of the number of Learners taking the qualification; and is not included in the Standard Qualification Fee.
*[Learners]: Learner: A person who is registered to take a qualification and to be assessed as part of that qualification.
*[Centre]: Centre: An organisation undertaking the delivery of an assessment (and potentially other activities) to Learners on behalf of an awarding organisation. Centres are typically educational institutions, training providers, or employers.
*[Learner]: Learner: A person who is registered to take a qualification and to be assessed as part of that qualification.
*[Assessment Standards Scrutiny]: Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny: The process through which an Awarding Organisation: periodically scrutinises the marking of assessments by a Centre to ensure that it has not deviated from required standards; considers whether it is appropriate to correct any mark and, if appropriate, corrects that mark (including where changes are required under Condition H2.5(b)); in line with Condition H6.3(b), considers whether it is appropriate to correct any incorrect result and, if appropriate, corrects that result; and takes action to prevent such deviation from recurring.
*[Moderation]: Moderation: A particular form of Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny through which the marking of assessments by Centres is monitored to make sure it meets required standards and through which adjustments to a Centre’s marking are made, where required, to ensure that results are based on the required standard. Moderation takes place before final results are issued under Condition H6.1.
