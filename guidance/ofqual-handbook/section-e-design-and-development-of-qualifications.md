#  Section E - Design and development of qualifications

Rules about qualification design and development, including about
qualification titling, qualification specifications, credit, and qualification
size and level.

## Condition E1 - Qualifications having an objective and support

Condition E1 does not apply to [Ofqual-regulated apprenticeship end-point
assessments](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/epa-qualification-
level-conditions-and-requirements)

### Qualifications to have an objective

1. E1.1 An awarding organisation must ensure that each qualification which it makes available or proposes to make available – 
    1. (a) has a clear objective in accordance with this condition, and
    2. (b) meets that objective.

1. E1.2 The objective of a qualification must be such as to lead to a benefit for Learners who have reached a specified level of attainment, and may include – 
    1. (a) preparing Learners to progress to a qualification in the same subject area but at a higher level or requiring more specific knowledge, skills and understanding,
    2. (b) preparing Learners to progress to a qualification in another subject area,
    3. (c) meeting relevant programmes of learning,
    4. (d) preparing Learners for employment,
    5. (e) supporting a role in the workplace, or
    6. (f) giving Learners personal growth and engagement in learning.

### Qualifications to have support

1. E1.3 Where an awarding organisation proposes to make available any new qualification, it – 
    1. (a) must first consult Users of qualifications to ascertain whether there is support for the qualification, and
    2. (b) may only make available the qualification where it has evidence of sufficient support from Users of qualifications.

1. E1.4 For the purposes of Condition E1.3, the following considerations will in particular be relevant in determining what constitutes sufficient support – 
    1. (a) the objective of the new qualification,
    2. (b) whether the new qualification is intended to facilitate a particular route of progression for Learners, and
    3. (c) the number of Learners that the awarding organisation reasonably estimates is likely to take the new qualification.

1. E1.5 For the purposes of this condition, Users of qualifications will be deemed to support a new qualification if the prevailing view of those Users of qualifications is that the qualification would provide a benefit to Learners.

### Guidance on Condition E1

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

* describes the objective of its qualifications accurately and clearly;
* builds into its arrangements for the design and development of its qualifications time and resources to gather, consider and respond to potential Users’ views;
* seeks views from a range of potential Users of the qualification and listens and responds to their views;
* records the evidence it has of User support;
* makes available or puts forward for accreditation specific support from informed potential Users.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

* is the subject of complaints from Users that its qualifications are not meeting the intended objectives;
* makes available or puts forward for accreditation (where required) qualifications that do not have specific support from informed potential Users;
* ignores feedback received regarding support for a qualification;
* has support that refers to the awarding organisation or the qualification type, rather than clearly relating to the proposed qualification and its subject.

## Condition E2 - Requirements on qualification titling

1. E2.1 An awarding organisation must ensure that the title on the Register of any qualification which it makes available includes the following information – 
    1. (a) the name of the awarding organisation,
    2. (b) the level of the qualification,
    3. (c) the type of qualification (where the qualification has a type),
    4. (d) a concise indication of the content of the qualification, and
    5. (e) any Endorsement known at the time the qualification is submitted to the Register.

1. E2.2 An awarding organisation must, in addition – 
    1. (a) ensure that the title on the Register reflects the knowledge, skills and understanding which will be assessed as part of the qualification, and
    2. (b) take all reasonable steps to ensure that the title allows Users of qualifications to identify similar units or qualifications which it makes available or are made available by other awarding organisations.

1. E2.3 An awarding organisation must ensure that each qualification which it makes available, or proposes to make available, has a title which it uses consistently in its advertising and in its communications with Users of qualifications.

1. E2.4 An awarding organisation must ensure that the titles of qualifications which it makes available, or proposes to make available, are not misleading to Users of qualifications.

1. E2.5 An awarding organisation must ensure that it amends the title on the Register for a qualification which it makes available when it makes any revision to a level assigned to that qualification.

### Guidance on Condition E2

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The title of a qualification:

* includes the name of the awarding organisation in full or in abbreviated form if the abbreviated form is widely used and recognised;
* includes the level of the qualification which has been determined by reference to the level descriptors in accordance with the requirements referred to in Condition E9.3;
* only includes the term ‘NVQ’ if the qualification is based on recognised occupational standards, confers occupational competence and requires work-based assessment and/or assessment in an environment that simulates the work place;
* only uses the terms – 
    * ‘award’ to indicate a small-sized qualification (i.e. a qualification that has a TQT value of 120 or less);
    * ‘certificate’ to indicate a medium-sized qualification (i.e. a qualification that has a TQT value in the range 121-369)
    * ‘diploma’ to indicate a large-sized qualification (i.e. a qualification with a TQT value of 370 or more);

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The title of a qualification includes:

* terms that are misleading or cannot be justified, for example – 
    * terms associated with higher education qualifications that are referenced to the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications such as Honours, Masters, Graduate and Postgraduate;
    * terms that cannot be justified such as ‘higher’, ‘extended’ or ‘advanced’ when the qualification is not provided as a progression route from another qualification;
    * subjective statements about the qualification which may be misleading;
* the term ‘QCF’ after 31 December 2017.

## Condition E3 - Publication of a qualification specification

* certain qualifications undergoing withdrawal

[Read more about these
exemptions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulated-
qualifications-framework-transitional-arrangements)

1. E7.1 In respect of each qualification which it makes available or proposes to make available, an awarding organisation must assign to that qualification a number of hours for – 
    1. (a) Total Qualification Time, and

### Interpretation

1. E7.9 For the purposes of this condition, references to a ‘qualification’ are references to the qualification as a whole and not to individual units.

### Guidance on Condition E7

Values for Total Qualification Time, including Guided Learning, are calculated
by considering the different activities that Learners would typically complete
to achieve and demonstrate the learning outcomes of a qualification. They do
not include activities which are required by a Learner’s Teacher based on the
requirements of an individual Learner and/or cohort. Individual Learners’
requirements and individual teaching styles mean there will be variation in
the actual time taken to complete a qualification. Values for Total
Qualification Time, including Guided Learning, are estimates.

Some examples of activities which can contribute to Total Qualification Time
include

* Independent and unsupervised research/learning
* Unsupervised compilation of a portfolio of work experience
* Unsupervised e-learning
* Unsupervised e-assessment
* Unsupervised coursework
* Watching a pre-recorded podcast or webinar
* Unsupervised work-based learning
* All Guided Learning

Some examples of activities which can contribute to Guided Learning include:

* Classroom-based learning supervised by a Teacher
* Work-based learning supervised by a Teacher
* Live webinar or telephone tutorial with a Teacher in real time
* E-learning supervised by a Teacher in real time
* All forms of assessment which take place under the Immediate Guidance or Supervision of a lecturer, supervisor, tutor or other appropriate provider of education or training, including where the assessment is competence-based and may be turned into a learning opportunity.

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

* has Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning values for its qualifications that are broadly in line with similar qualifications;
* can explain its decision about the Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning values for its qualifications where these values differ from those of similar qualifications;
* considers and responds to the views of potential Users of the qualifications on the proposed Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning values and builds into its qualification development process the time to do so;
* has and retains evidence to support its assignment from informed potential and/or existing Users of qualifications about the Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning values;
* gathers, considers and responds to the views of existing Users of the qualification to review the Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning values and builds into its arrangements for the review of its qualifications the time and resources to do so;
* can explain its decision about the Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning values required for the qualification, with reference to the available evidence and the intended cohort for the qualification;
* where it makes an assignment before the qualification is first made available, gathers and considers evidence of the actual time typically taken by Learners in the first cohort to complete the qualification and revises the number of hours of Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning if appropriate;
* considers feedback from Users of qualifications about the accuracy of values assigned to a qualification for Total Qualification Time and Guided Learning, and revises those values if appropriate.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation –

* does not review its approach to calculating the number of hours for Total Qualification Time and/or Guided Learning following complaints or in response to negative feedback about that approach;
* does not review the number of hours assigned to a qualification for Total Qualification Time and/or Guided Learning following complaints or in response to negative feedback in relation to that number of hours;
* disregards feedback and evidence from Users of qualifications about the Total Qualification Time and/or Guided Learning values required;
* has Total Qualification Time and/or Guided Learning values for a qualification that are not comparable with those of similar qualifications and lacks evidence to support the difference in values.

1. E10.2 In any circumstances where the policy it has in place permits the Recognition of Prior Learning, an awarding organisation must ensure the policy enables it to award qualifications in a way that complies with its Conditions of Recognition.

### Guidance on Condition E10

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation’s published policy for Recognition of Prior Learning
(RPL):

* is open, transparent and clear to Learners and Users of qualifications;
* in any circumstances where the awarding organisation chooses to recognise prior learning: 
    * sets out the evidence of prior learning that will be required by the awarding organisation;

The awarding organisation ensures that:

* any decisions on an application for RPL are carried out by staff who are competent to consider and make decisions about RPL;
* its policy for RPL is regularly reviewed and, where appropriate, amended; and
* any qualification awarded to a Learner who has made a successful application for RPL provides a valid and reliable indication of that Learner’s knowledge, skills and understanding.

##  Total Qualification Time Criteria

These criteria are set and published by Ofqual under section [146(1)(b) of the
Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/22/section/146) and General
Condition E7, and apply to all awarding organisations in respect of all
qualifications regulated by Ofqual.

Taken together, [section 145 of the

## Level requirements (including level descriptors)

1. General Condition E9.3(c) allows us to specify requirements which an awarding organisation must follow when assigning – 
    1. (a) a level to a qualification,
    2. (b) more than one level to a qualification, and
    3. (c) a level to a Component of a qualification.
2. We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition E9.3(c) below.

### Assigning a level to a qualification

When assigning a level to each of its qualifications in accordance with
Condition E9.1, an awarding organisation must use the level descriptors set
out below to select the most appropriate level to assign to that
qualification.

### Assigning more than one level to a qualification

1. When assigning more than one level to a qualification an awarding organisation must – 
    1. (a) be satisfied that the range of achievement recognised by the qualification is sufficient to span more than one level,
    2. (b) use the level descriptors set out below to select the most appropriate levels to assign to that qualification,
    3. (c) have a clear rationale for assigning more than one level to that qualification, and
    4. (d) publish that rationale.

### Assigning a level to a component of a qualification

1. When assigning a level to a Component of a qualification in accordance with Condition E9.2 an awarding organisation must – 
    1. (a) use the level descriptors set out below to select the most appropriate level to assign to that Component, and
    2. (b) take all reasonable steps to ensure that the level assigned to each Component is appropriate when considered against the level assigned to the qualification as a whole.

### Level descriptors

The level descriptors are divided into two categories –

* knowledge and understanding; and
* skills.

There is a knowledge descriptor and a skills descriptor for each level within
the framework. The descriptors apply to all the qualifications we regulate,
general and vocational, and so many of the descriptors have an “and/or”
construction to indicate their applicability to the knowledge and skills
associated with the study of a subject or in preparation for a job or role.

The level descriptors build on those used within the Qualifications and Credit
Framework (QCF) and the European Qualifications Framework (EQF). Levels 4-8
are intended to be consistent with the five levels within the Framework for
Higher Education Qualification in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (FHEQ).

The descriptors set out the generic knowledge and skills associated with the
typical holder of a qualification at that level. The level descriptors are
framed as outcomes and each category starts with a stem statement (“the holder
can…”) which then links into the outcomes associated with each level of the
framework.

The descriptors for the knowledge and skills associated with Entry 1
achievement are the exception to this. The Entry 1 descriptors are based on a
continuum of achievement which can be used to track and recognise progress
towards the achievement of student-centred targets.

None of the descriptors is intended to point to the process of learning or to
specific assessment methods.

Level | Knowledge descriptor (the holder…) | Skills descriptor (the holder can…)  
---|---|---  
Entry 1 | Progresses along a continuum that ranges from the most elementary of achievements to beginning to make use of knowledge and/or understanding that relate to the subject or immediate environment. | Progress along a continuum that ranges from the most elementary of achievements to beginning to make use of skills that relate to the subject or the immediate environment.

### Guidance on level and level descriptors

General Condition E9.3(c) allows us to specify guidance to which an awarding
organisation must have regard when assigning –  
(a) a level to a qualification  
(b) more than one level to a qualification  
(c) a level to a Component of a qualification  


We set out our guidance for the purposes of Condition E9.3(c) below.

### Who can use the level descriptors?

The level descriptors must be used by awarding organisations when they are
assigning a level to a qualification and a Component of a qualification. Level
descriptors can also be used by –

* students and other Users – to understand and interpret the level of qualifications,
* anyone who wants to understand more about the difference between and relative demand of qualifications at different levels.

### How should awarding organisations use the level descriptors?

Awarding organisations should look at the range of level descriptors and
identify the descriptor (or where the qualification will have more than one
level, the descriptors) which provides the best match with the intended
knowledge and skills outcomes for their qualification. Once the awarding
organisation has designed the qualification, they could look at the descriptor
for the level above and below the proposed level for the qualification and
compare the knowledge and skills descriptors for each level with the
knowledge, skills and understanding which the holder of the qualification is
expected to demonstrate. The fit does not have to be perfect; qualifications
might naturally have a more knowledge- or skills-based focus and so will be a
better fit with the knowledge or skills descriptor as appropriate.  

Awarding organisations can also look at a range of other material to support
the selection of the most appropriate level for their qualification including
other qualifications at a range of levels, benchmark and content statements
and agreed industry statements.  

Awarding organisations and users should not expect all qualifications to meet
the relevant level descriptor in full. It would not be unusual for smaller
qualifications to cover only some of the characteristics set out in the
descriptor whereas bigger qualifications, typically taken over a longer
period, are more likely to feature more of the characteristics. The
descriptors set out what the typical holder of a qualification at that level
will know and be able to do based on the best-fit approach described above.  

Awarding organisations and users should not expect all of a qualification’s
content and assessment to be at the level the learner is expected to reach on
conclusion of the qualification. This will be particularly true of
qualifications delivered over a longer period and which are designed to enable
the learner to progress from one level to another within the qualification. In
assigning a level to a qualification the awarding organisation should have
regard to the amount of content and assessment at the level of the
qualification and to the learner’s increased ability as the learner approaches
the end of the qualification.

### How will Ofqual use the descriptors?

We will use the descriptors to inform our review process, particularly when we
are exploring how awarding organisations check and verify the given level of
their qualification with these descriptors for that level.
