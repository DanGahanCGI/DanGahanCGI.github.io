### Guidance on Condition B3

#### Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

* identifies events that have occurred or are likely to occur that could have, or has had, an Adverse Effect and notifies Ofqual promptly;
* has staff who take timely, informed decisions and exercise appropriate judgement when deciding when to report events to Ofqual, and when managing events;
* notifies Ofqual of events that have occurred or are likely to occur that could have, or has had, an Adverse Effect irrespective of whether the event is being managed through established contingency plans;
* has clear decision-making and timely escalation processes for identifying and determining whether an event could have, or has had, an Adverse Effect;
* balances the need to gather sufficient evidence to identify whether an Adverse Effect has occurred or is likely to occur, with the need promptly to notify Ofqual of the event, prioritising prompt notification over waiting for all evidence to be available, taking account of: 
    * the actual or potential impact on Learners;
    * its assessment of the seriousness of the event, taking account of the factors set out in the guidance on making a notification below;
    * the urgency of any actions required to mitigate the actual or potential Adverse Effect (for example, because of proximity to an assessment on a specific date, or to the issuing of results or certificates);
    * how long it will take the awarding organisation to gather evidence and decide on, and take, key decisions or actions;
    * the actual or potential impact on public confidence, such as if the event has been or is likely to be reported in the media or on social media;
* provides information to Ofqual when making a notification that includes: 
    * what has happened or is likely to happen and why;
    * how and when it became aware of the event;
    * its assessment of the seriousness of the event and of its actual or potential Adverse Effect, and the basis on which this assessment was made, taking account of any information from Ofqual (for example if Ofqual has asked for specific information about certain types of event) about how particular types of event should be reported;
    * the possible or actual impact of the event on Learners or public confidence (in terms of both the type of Learner(s) affected and volume of Learners affected), including any impact on the standards or validity of qualifications;
    * the actions it has taken or plans to take to prevent, correct or mitigate as far as is possible any actual or potential Adverse Effect, to identify its cause and to prevent the event from reoccurring;
    * the qualifications, subjects and units affected, including the dates and details of any affected assessments;
    * its assessment of the scale of the event including, where possible, the number of Centres and Learners affected, with a country location breakdown;
    * any relevant supporting information or documents relating to the event, for example, copies of assessment materials in the case of question paper errors or details of system failures in the event of an issue with an online assessment system;
    * how it is monitoring the event to ensure its assessment of the seriousness remains accurate and that its actions remain appropriate;
    * whether Centres, Learners, media or other stakeholders are aware and details of any complaints or correspondence it has received about the event;
    * the expected timescales for resolving and/or mitigating the impact of the event;
    * how it will keep Ofqual informed throughout its management of the event;
    * any other organisations or agencies that are involved;
* provides sufficiently detailed information to enable Ofqual to understand the nature of the event and the actions taken by the awarding organisation;
* where full information is not available at the point when the awarding organisation notifies Ofqual, provides an indication of what further information will be provided and when;
* in supplying information to Ofqual, takes account of requirements relating to the protection of personal information, and where relevant, the need to protect the confidentiality of assessment materials;
* provides regular updates and relevant information as agreed with Ofqual, throughout its management of the event;
* keeps its decisions about whether or not an event has an actual or potential Adverse Effect under review as circumstances and/or its understanding of the event change;
* notifies Ofqual of any event under B3.3 sufficiently far ahead of any changes taking place and provides relevant supporting evidence as required by Ofqual, which could include: 
    * a description of any changes which are being made;
    * relevant documents which confirm any changes or the likely nature of potential changes;
    * plans for how the awarding organisation will ensure that no Learners are unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged as a result of any change;
    * the steps it will take to make sure it will remain compliant with its Conditions of Recognition;
* notifies Ofqual (as required by Condition B3.4) of its plans to offer qualifications which are substantially different before it starts marketing, promoting or offering them, for example when it intends to offer qualifications: 
    * of a nature which it does not have experience offering;
    * in a sector for which it has not previously offered qualifications;
    * at a level which it has not previously offered qualifications;
    * using a method of assessment it has not previously used.

#### Examples of ‘negative indicators’ that would suggest an awarding
organisation is not likely to comply

The awarding organisation:

* does not have a clear and effective process for managing event notifications;
* fails to inform Ofqual promptly and provide sufficient detail of events which have had, or could have an Adverse Effect;
* does not notify Ofqual of an event which has had, or could have an Adverse Effect before Ofqual becomes aware of it through other means (for example through complaints by Learners or Centres, media reports or reports from other agencies) where it would have been possible to do so;
* does not provide regular and timely updates for an event which it has reported, as it manages the event;
* does not manage event notifications effectively, leading to a delayed or inappropriate resolution which adversely impacts Learners, public confidence or standards;
* experiences reoccurrences of the same or similar event where this could have been prevented;
* does not respond fully or accurately to requests from Ofqual for further information;
* provides inaccurate reports of events that could have an Adverse Effect, such as: 
    * inaccurate reporting of the number of events which occur;
    * inaccurate or misleading assessments of the seriousness of the event;
* does not alert Ofqual to a material change in its governance or ownership or until after the event;
* does not alert Ofqual when it becomes evident its financial security is at risk;
* does not alert Ofqual to its plans to introduce substantially different qualifications sufficiently far ahead of submitting them to the Register (to allow Ofqual to consider the need for any additional requirements that may apply, such as an accreditation requirement or special condition), or where an accreditation requirement applies, before it submits them for accreditation (to allow time for the accreditation of that qualification);
* starts marketing a qualification, registering Learners or offering a qualification that is substantially different in type or content to any qualification it has previously made available before notifying Ofqual of its intentions.
